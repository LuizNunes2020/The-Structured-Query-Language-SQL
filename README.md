# The-Structured-Query-Language-SQL

This repository includes queries created for the course The Structured Query Language (SQL) (available at: https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-structured-query-language-sql/). The "/Verbs-and-syntax" folder contains the codes utilized during the lectures, whereas the "/Labs" folder provides the solutions to the laboratory exercises. All queries, except for final_lab.sql, are based on the Northwind database (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/downloading-sample-databases). The final_lab.sql query is associated with the "Classic Models" database, as described in the file classic_models.txt.
